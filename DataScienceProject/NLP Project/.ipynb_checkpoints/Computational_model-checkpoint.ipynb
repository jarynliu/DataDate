Our epoch, the epoch of the\\n', 'bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has\\n', 'simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more\\n', 'splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes,\\n', 'directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\\n', '\\n', 'From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the\\n', 'earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the\\n', 'bourgeoisie were developed.\\n', '\\n', 'The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh\\n', 'ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets,\\n', 'the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in\\n', 'the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce,\\n', 'to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby,\\n', 'to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid\\n', 'development.\\n', '\\n', 'The feudal system of industry, under which industrial production was\\n', 'monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing\\n', 'wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The\\n', 'guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle\\n', 'class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds\\n', 'vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop.\\n', '\\n', 'Meantime the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even\\n', 'manufacture no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery\\n', 'revolutionised industrial production. The place of manufacture was\\n', 'taken by the giant, Modern Industry, the place of the industrial middle\\n', 'class, by industrial millionaires, the leaders of whole industrial\\n', 'armies, the modern bourgeois.\\n', '\\n', 'Modern industry has established the world-market, for which the\\n', 'discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an immense\\n', 'development to commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This\\n', 'development has, in its time, reacted on the extension of industry; and\\n', 'in proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in\\n', 'the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital,\\n', 'and pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle\\n', 'Ages.\\n', '\\n', 'We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of\\n', 'a long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes\\n', 'of production and of exchange.\\n', '\\n', 'Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a\\n', 'corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under\\n', 'the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing\\n', 'association in the mediaeval commune; here independent urban republic\\n', '(as in Italy and Germany), there taxable “third estate” of the monarchy\\n', '(as in France), afterwards, in the period of manufacture proper,\\n', 'serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a\\n', 'counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, corner-stone of the\\n', 'great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the\\n', 'establishment of Modern Industry and of the world-market, conquered for\\n', 'itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway.\\n', 'The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the\\n', 'common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to\\n', 'all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn\\n', 'asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural\\n', 'superiors,” and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man\\n', 'than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment.” It has drowned\\n', 'the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous\\n', 'enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of\\n', 'egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange\\n', 'value, and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered\\n', 'freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In\\n', 'one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political\\n', 'illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto\\n', 'honoured and looked up to with reverent awe.

It\\n', 'has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It has\\n', 'accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts,\\n', 'and Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the\\n', 'shade all former Exoduses of nations and crusades.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the\\n', 'instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and\\n', 'with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes\\n', 'of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first\\n', 'condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant\\n', 'revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social\\n', 'conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the\\n', 'bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen\\n', 'relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and\\n', 'opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before\\n', 'they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is\\n', 'profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his\\n', 'real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\\n', '\\n', 'The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the\\n', 'bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle\\n', 'everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions everywhere.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given\\n', 'a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every\\n', 'country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under\\n', 'the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All\\n', 'old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily\\n', 'being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose\\n', 'introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised\\n', 'nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material,\\n', 'but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose\\n', 'products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the\\n', 'globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the productions of the\\n', 'country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the\\n', 'products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and\\n', 'national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every\\n', 'direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material,\\n', 'so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of\\n', 'individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and\\n', 'narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the\\n', 'numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world\\n', 'literature.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of\\n', 'production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws\\n', 'all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap\\n', 'prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters\\n', 'down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians’ intensely\\n', 'obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations,\\n', 'on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it\\n', 'compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst,\\n', '_i.e_., to become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world\\n', 'after its own image.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It\\n', 'has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population\\n', 'as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of\\n', 'the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the\\n', 'country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and\\n', 'semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones, nations of\\n', 'peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.\\n', '\\n', 'The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state\\n', 'of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has\\n', 'agglomerated production, and has concentrated property in a few hands.\\n', 'The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation.\\n', 'Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate\\n', 'interests, laws, governments and systems of taxation, became lumped\\n', 'together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one\\n', 'national class-interest, one frontier and one customs-tariff. The\\n', 'bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created\\n', 'more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all\\n', 'preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man,\\n', 'machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture,\\n', 'steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole\\n', 'continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations\\n', 'conjured out of the ground—what earlier century had even a presentiment\\n', 'that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?\\n', '\\n', 'We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose\\n', 'foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal\\n', 'society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of\\n', 'production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society\\n', 'produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and\\n', 'manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property\\n', 'became no longer compatible with the already developed productive\\n', 'forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they\\n', 'were burst asunder.\\n', '\\n', 'Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and\\n', 'political constitution adapted to it, and by the economical and\\n', 'political sway of the bourgeois class.\\n', '\\n', 'A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois\\n', 'society with its relations of production, of exchange and of property,\\n', 'a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of\\n', 'exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the\\n', 'powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For\\n', 'many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the\\n', 'history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern\\n', 'conditions of production, against the property relations that are the\\n', 'conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule. It is\\n', 'enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return\\n', 'put on its trial, each time more threateningly, the existence of the\\n', 'entire bourgeois society. In these crises a great part not only of the\\n', 'existing products, but also of the previously created productive\\n', 'forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises there breaks out an\\n', 'epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an\\n', 'absurdity—the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds\\n', 'itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a\\n', 'famine, a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every\\n', 'means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and\\n', 'why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of\\n', 'subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive\\n', 'forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the\\n', 'development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary,\\n', 'they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are\\n', 'fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring\\n', 'disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of\\n', 'bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow\\n', 'to comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie\\n', 'get over these crises? On the one hand inforced destruction of a mass\\n', 'of productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and\\n', 'by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by\\n', 'paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by\\n', 'diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.\\n', '\\n', 'The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground\\n', 'are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.\\n', '\\n', 'But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to\\n', 'itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield\\n', 'those weapons—the modern working class—the proletarians.\\n', '\\n', 'In proportion as the bourgeoisie, _i.e_., capital, is developed, in the\\n', 'same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class,\\n', 'developed—a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find\\n', 'work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital.\\n', 'These labourers, who must sell themselves piece-meal, are a commodity,\\n', 'like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to\\n', 'all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the\\n', 'market.\\n', '\\n', 'Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour, the\\n', 'work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and\\n', 'consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the\\n', 'machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most\\n', 'easily acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of\\n', 'production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of\\n', 'subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the\\n', 'propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore\\n', 'also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion\\n', 'therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage\\n', 'decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division\\n', 'of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also\\n', 'increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by increase of\\n', 'the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the\\n', 'machinery, etc.\\n', '\\n', 'Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal\\n', 'master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of\\n', 'labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As\\n', 'privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a\\n', 'perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves\\n', 'of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and\\n', 'hourly enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by\\n', 'the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this\\n', 'despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the\\n', 'more hateful and the more embittering it is.\\n', '\\n', 'The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour,\\n', 'in other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is\\n', 'the labour of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and\\n', 'sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working\\n', 'class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use,\\n', 'according to their age and sex.\\n', '\\n', 'No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so\\n', 'far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon\\n', 'by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper,\\n', 'the pawnbroker, etc.\\n', '\\n', 'The lower strata of the middle class—the small tradespeople,\\n', 'shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and\\n', 'peasants—all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because\\n', 'their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern\\n', 'Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the\\n', 'large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is rendered\\n', 'worthless by the new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is\\n', 'recruited from all classes of the population.\\n', '\\n', 'The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its\\n', 'birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is\\n', 'carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of a\\n', 'factory, then by the operatives of one trade, in one locality, against\\n', 'the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their\\n', 'attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against\\n', 'the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares\\n', 'that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they\\n', 'set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status\\n', 'of the workman of the Middle Ages.\\n', '\\n', 'At this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered\\n', 'over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If\\n', 'anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the\\n', 'consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the\\n', 'bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is\\n', 'compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet,\\n', 'for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians\\n', 'do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the\\n', 'remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial\\n', 'bourgeois, the petty bourgeoisie. Thus the whole historical movement is\\n', 'concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained\\n', 'is a victory for the bourgeoisie.\\n', '\\n', 'But with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases\\n', 'in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength\\n', 'grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and\\n', 'conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and\\n', 'more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions\\n', 'of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level.\\n', 'The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting\\n', 'commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating.\\n', 'The unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing,\\n', 'makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between\\n', 'individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the\\n', 'character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon the workers\\n', 'begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against the bourgeois; they\\n', 'club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found\\n', 'permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these\\n', 'occasional revolts. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots.\\n', '\\n', 'Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real\\n', 'fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the\\n', 'ever-expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the\\n', 'improved means of communication that are created by modern industry and\\n', 'that place the workers of different localities in contact with one\\n', 'another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the\\n', 'numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national\\n', 'struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political\\n', 'struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the Middle\\n', 'Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, the modern\\n', 'proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.\\n', '\\n', 'This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and consequently\\n', 'into a political party, is continually being upset again by the\\n', 'competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again,\\n', 'stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of\\n', 'particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the\\n', 'divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. Thus the ten-hours’ bill in\\n', 'England was carried.\\n', '\\n', 'Altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further,\\n', 'in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat. The\\n', 'bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with\\n', 'the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie\\n', 'itself, whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of\\n', 'industry; at all times, with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In\\n', 'all these battles it sees itself compelled to appeal to the\\n', 'proletariat, to ask for its help, and thus, to drag it into the\\n', 'political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the\\n', 'proletariat with its own instruments of political and general\\n', 'education, in other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons\\n', 'for fighting the bourgeoisie.\\n', '\\n', 'Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling classes\\n', 'are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or\\n', 'are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also\\n', 'supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and\\n', 'progress.\\n', '\\n', 'Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the\\n', 'process of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within\\n', 'the whole range of society, assumes such a violent, glaring character,\\n', 'that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins\\n', 'the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands.\\n', 'Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility\\n', 'went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes\\n', 'over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois\\n', 'ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending\\n', 'theoretically the historical movement as a whole.\\n', '\\n', 'Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today,\\n', 'the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other\\n', 'classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the\\n', 'proletariat is its special and essential product. The lower middle\\n', 'class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the\\n', 'peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from\\n', 'extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are\\n', 'therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are\\n', 'reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by\\n', 'chance they are revolutionary, they are so only in view of their\\n', 'impending transfer into the proletariat, they thus defend not their\\n', 'present, but their future interests, they desert their own standpoint\\n', 'to place themselves at that of the proletariat.\\n', '\\n', 'The “dangerous class,” the social scum, that passively rotting mass\\n', 'thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, here and there, be\\n', 'swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of\\n', 'life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of\\n', 'reactionary intrigue.\\n', '\\n', 'In the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large are\\n', 'already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property; his\\n', 'relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with\\n', 'the bourgeois family-relations; modern industrial labour, modern\\n', 'subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as\\n', 'in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of national character. Law,\\n', 'morality, religion, are to him so many bourgeois prejudices, behind\\n', 'which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.\\n', '\\n', 'All the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to fortify\\n', 'their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their\\n', 'conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters of\\n', 'the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own\\n', 'previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous\\n', 'mode of appropriation. They have nothing of their own to secure and to\\n', 'fortify; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for, and\\n', 'insurances of, individual property.\\n', '\\n', 'All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in\\n', 'the interests of minorities. The proletarian movement is the\\n', 'self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the\\n', 'interests of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum\\n', 'of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without\\n', 'the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into\\n', 'the air.\\n', '\\n', 'Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat\\n', 'with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat\\n', 'of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its\\n', 'own bourgeoisie.\\n', '\\n', 'In depicting the most general phases of the development of the\\n', 'proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within\\n', 'existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open\\n', 'revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the\\n', 'foundation for the sway of the proletariat.\\n', '\\n', 'Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already\\n', 'seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in\\n', 'order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it\\n', 'under which it can, at least, continue its slavish existence. The serf,\\n', 'in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune,\\n', 'just as the petty bourgeois, under the yoke of feudal absolutism,\\n', 'managed to develop into a bourgeois. The modern laborer, on the\\n', 'contrary, instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper\\n', 'and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He\\n', 'becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population\\n', 'and wealth. And here it becomes evident, that the bourgeoisie is unfit\\n', 'any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its\\n', 'conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law. It is unfit\\n', 'to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave\\n', 'within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a\\n', 'state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society\\n', 'can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its\\n', 'existence is no longer compatible with society.\\n', '\\n', 'The essential condition for the existence, and for the sway of the\\n', 'bourgeois class, is the formation and augmentation of capital; the\\n', 'condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour rests exclusively on\\n', 'competition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose\\n', 'involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the\\n', 'labourers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination, due\\n', 'to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts\\n', 'from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie\\n', 'produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore,\\n', 'produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers.

And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express\\n', 'the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having\\n', 'overcome “French one-sidedness” and of representing, not true\\n', 'requirements, but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the\\n', 'proletariat, but the interests of Human Nature, of Man in general, who\\n', 'belongs to no class, has no reality, who exists only in the misty realm\\n', 'of philosophical fantasy.\\n', '\\n', 'This German Socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and\\n', 'solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such mountebank\\n', 'fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence.\\n', '\\n', 'The fight of the German, and especially, of the Prussian bourgeoisie,\\n', 'against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the\\n', 'liberal movement, became more earnest.\\n', '\\n', 'By this, the long wished-for opportunity was offered to “True”\\n', 'Socialism of confronting the political movement with the Socialist\\n', 'demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism,\\n', 'against representative government, against bourgeois competition,\\n', 'bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois legislation, bourgeois\\n', 'liberty and equality, and of preaching to the masses that they had\\n', 'nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by this bourgeois movement.\\n', 'German Socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that the French\\n', 'criticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the existence of modern\\n', 'bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic conditions of\\n', 'existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very\\n', 'things whose attainment was the object of the pending struggle in\\n', 'Germany.\\n', '\\n', 'To the absolute governments, with their following of parsons,\\n', 'professors, country squires and officials, it served as a welcome\\n', 'scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and bullets\\n', 'with which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the German\\n', 'working-class risings.\\n', '\\n', 'While this “True” Socialism thus served the governments as a weapon for\\n', 'fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly\\n', 'represented a reactionary interest, the interest of the German\\n', 'Philistines. In Germany the _petty bourgeois_ class, a _relique_ of the\\n', 'sixteenth century, and since then constantly cropping up again under\\n', 'various forms, is the real social basis of the existing state of\\n', 'things.\\n', '\\n', 'To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in\\n', 'Germany.

This form of Socialism has, moreover, been worked out into\\n', 'complete systems.\\n', '\\n', 'We may cite Proudhon’s _Philosophie de la Misère_ as an example of this\\n', 'form.\\n', '\\n', 'The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social\\n', 'conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting\\n', 'therefrom.

By changes in the\\n', 'material conditions of existence, this form of Socialism, however, by\\n', 'no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of\\n', 'production, an abolition that can be effected only by a revolution, but\\n', 'administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these\\n', 'relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations\\n', 'between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and\\n', 'simplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.\\n', '\\n', 'Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression, when, and only when,\\n', 'it becomes a mere figure of speech.\\n', '\\n', 'Free trade: for the benefit of the working class.

CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM\\n', '\\n', 'We do not here refer to that literature which, in every great modern\\n', 'revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat,\\n', 'such as the writings of Babeuf and others.\\n', '\\n', 'The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends,\\n', 'made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society was being\\n', 'overthrown, these attempts necessarily failed, owing to the then\\n', 'undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of the\\n', 'economic conditions for its emancipation, conditions that had yet to be\\n', 'produced, and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone.\\n', 'The revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of\\n', 'the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated\\n', 'universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form.\\n', '\\n', 'The Socialist and Communist systems properly so called, those of\\n', 'Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen and others, spring into existence in the\\n', 'early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle between\\n', 'proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois and\\n', 'Proletarians).\\n', '\\n', 'The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as\\n', 'well as the action of the decomposing elements, in the prevailing form\\n', 'of society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them\\n', 'the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any\\n', 'independent political movement.\\n', '\\n', 'Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the\\n', 'development of industry, the economic situation, as they find it, does\\n', 'not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation\\n', 'of the proletariat. They therefore search after a new social science,\\n', 'after new social laws, that are to create these conditions.\\n', '\\n', 'Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action,\\n', 'historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones, and\\n', 'the gradual, spontaneous class-organisation of the proletariat to the\\n', 'organisation of society specially contrived by these inventors. Future\\n', 'history resolves itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the\\n', 'practical carrying out of their social plans.\\n', '\\n', 'In the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring chiefly\\n', 'for the interests of the working class, as being the most suffering\\n', 'class. Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class\\n', 'does the proletariat exist for them.\\n', '\\n', 'The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own\\n', 'surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far\\n', 'superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition\\n', 'of every member of society, even that of the most favoured. Hence, they\\n', 'habitually appeal to society at large, without distinction of class;\\n', 'nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once\\n', 'they understand their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan\\n', 'of the best possible state of society?\\n', '\\n', 'Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary,\\n', 'action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, and\\n', 'endeavour, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by\\n', 'the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel.\\n', '\\n', 'Such fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the\\n', 'proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a\\n', 'fantastic conception of its own position correspond with the first\\n', 'instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of\\n', 'society.\\n', '\\n', 'But these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical\\n', 'element. They attack every principle of existing society. Hence they\\n', 'are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the\\n', 'working class. The practical measures proposed in them—such as the\\n', 'abolition of the distinction between town and country, of the family,\\n', 'of the carrying on of industries for the account of private\\n', 'individuals, and of the wage system, the proclamation of social\\n', 'harmony, the conversion of the functions of the State into a mere\\n', 'superintendence of production, all these proposals, point solely to the\\n', 'disappearance of class antagonisms which were, at that time, only just\\n', 'cropping up, and which, in these publications, are recognised in their\\n', 'earliest, indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals,\\n', 'therefore, are of a purely Utopian character.\\n', '\\n', 'The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism bears an\\n', 'inverse relation to historical development. In proportion as the modern\\n', 'class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this fantastic\\n', 'standing apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose\\n', 'all practical value and all theoretical justification. Therefore,\\n', 'although the originators of these systems were, in many respects,\\n', 'revolutionary, their disciples have, in every case, formed mere\\n', 'reactionary sects. They hold fast by the original views of their\\n', 'masters, in opposition to the progressive historical development of the\\n', 'proletariat. They, therefore, endeavour, and that consistently, to\\n', 'deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They\\n', 'still dream of experimental realisation of their social Utopias, of\\n', 'founding isolated “phalansteres,” of establishing “Home Colonies,” of\\n', 'setting up a “Little Icaria”—duodecimo editions of the New\\n', 'Jerusalem—and to realise all these castles in the air, they are\\n', 'compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois. By\\n', 'degrees they sink into the category of the reactionary conservative\\n', 'Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more systematic\\n', 'pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the\\n', 'miraculous effects of their social science.\\n', '\\n', 'They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of\\n', 'the working class; such action, according to them, can only result from\\n', 'blind unbelief in the new Gospel.\\n', '\\n', 'The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively,\\n', 'oppose the Chartists and the “Réformistes.”\\n', '\\n', 'IV.\\n', 'POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS IN RELATION TO THE VARIOUS EXISTING\\n', 'OPPOSITION PARTIES\\n', '\\n', 'Section II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the\\n', 'existing working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England and\\n', 'the Agrarian Reformers in America.\\n', '\\n', 'The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the\\n', 'enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the\\n', 'movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the\\n', 'future of that movement.

      "the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class  struggles  freeman and slave patrician and plebeian lord and serf guild master  and journeyman in word oppressor and oppressed stood in constant  opposition to one another carried on an uninterrupted now hidden now  open fight fight that each time ended either in revolutionary  re constitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the  contending classes  in the earlier epochs of history we find almost everywhere  complicated arrangement of society into various orders manifold  gradation of social rank in ancient rome we have patricians knights  plebeians slaves in the middle ages feudal lords vassals  guild masters journeymen apprentices serfs in almost all of these  classes again subordinate gradations  the modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal  society has not done away with class antagonisms it has but  established new classes new conditions of oppression new forms of  struggle in place of the old ones our epoch the epoch of the  bourgeoisie possesses however this distinctive feature it has  simplified the class antagonisms society as whole is more and more  splitting up into two great hostile camps into two great classes  directly facing each other bourgeoisie and proletariat  from the serfs of the middle ages sprang the chartered burghers of the  earliest towns from these burgesses the first elements of the  bourgeoisie were developed  the discovery of america the rounding of the cape opened up fresh  ground for the rising bourgeoisie the east indian and chinese markets  the colonisation of america trade with the colonies the increase in  the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce  to navigation to industry an impulse never before known and thereby  to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society rapid  development  the feudal system of industry under which industrial production was  monopolised by closed guilds now no longer sufficed for the growing  wants of the new markets the manufacturing system took its place the  guild masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle  class division of labour between the different corporate guilds  vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop  meantime the markets kept ever growing the demand ever rising even  manufacture no longer sufficed thereupon steam and machinery  revolutionised industrial production the place of manufacture was  taken by the giant modern industry the place of the industrial middle  class by industrial millionaires the leaders of whole industrial  armies the modern bourgeois  modern industry has established the world market for which the  discovery of america paved the way this market has given an immense  development to commerce to navigation to communication by land this  development has in its time reacted on the extension of industry and  in proportion as industry commerce navigation railways extended in  the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed increased its capital  and pushed into the background every class handed down from the middle  ages  we see therefore how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of  a long course of development of series of revolutions in the modes  of production and of exchange  each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by  corresponding political advance of that class an oppressed class under  the sway of the feudal nobility an armed and self governing  association in the mediaeval commune here independent urban republic   as in italy and germany there taxable third estate of the monarchy   as in france afterwards in the period of manufacture proper  serving either the semi feudal or the absolute monarchy as  counterpoise against the nobility and in fact corner stone of the  great monarchies in general the bourgeoisie has at last since the  establishment of modern industry and of the world market conquered for  itself in the modern representative state exclusive political sway  the executive of the modern state is but committee for managing the  common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie  the bourgeoisie historically has played most revolutionary part  the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to  all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations it has pitilessly torn  asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his natural  superiors and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man  than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned  the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous  enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of  egotistical calculation it has resolved personal worth into exchange  value and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered  freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade in  one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political  illusions naked shameless direct brutal exploitation  the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto  honoured and looked up to with reverent awe it has converted the  physician the lawyer the priest the poet the man of science into  its paid wage labourers  the bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and  has reduced the family relation to mere money relation  the bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal  display of vigour in the middle ages which reactionists so much  admire found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence it  has been the first to show what man activity can bring about it has  accomplished wonders far surpassing egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts  and gothic cathedrals it has conducted expeditions that put in the  shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades  the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the  instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and  with them the whole relations of society conservation of the old modes  of production in unaltered form was on the contrary the first  condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes constant  revolutionising of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social  conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the  bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones all fixed fast frozen  relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and  opinions are swept away all new formed ones become antiquated before  they can ossify all that is solid melts into air all that is holy is  profaned and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his  real conditions of life and his relations with his kind  the need of constantly expanding market for its products chases the  bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe it must nestle  everywhere settle everywhere establish connexions everywhere  the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world market given  a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every  country to the great chagrin of reactionists it has drawn from under  the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood all  old established national industries have been destroyed or are daily  being destroyed they are dislodged by new industries whose  introduction becomes life and death question for all civilised  nations by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material  but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose  products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the  globe in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the  country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the  products of distant lands and climes in place of the old local and  national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every  direction universal inter dependence of nations and as in material  so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of  individual nations become common property national one sidedness and  narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the  numerous national and local literatures there arises world  literature  the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of  production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws  all even the most barbarian nations into civilisation the cheap  prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters  down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely  obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations  on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production it  compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst  _i e_ to become bourgeois themselves in one word it creates world  after its own image  the bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns it  has created enormous cities has greatly increased the urban population  as compared with the rural and has thus rescued considerable part of  the population from the idiocy of rural life just as it has made the  country dependent on the towns so it has made barbarian and  semi barbarian countries dependent on the civilised ones nations of  peasants on nations of bourgeois the east on the west  the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state  of the population of the means of production and of property it has  agglomerated production and has concentrated property in few hands  the necessary consequence of this was political centralisation  independent or but loosely connected provinces with separate  interests laws governments and systems of taxation became lumped  together into one nation with one government one code of laws one  national class interest one frontier and one customs tariff the  bourgeoisie during its rule of scarce one hundred years has created  more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all  preceding generations together subjection of nature forces to man  machinery application of chemistry to industry and agriculture  steam navigation railways electric telegraphs clearing of whole  continents for cultivation canalisation of rivers whole populations  conjured out of the ground what earlier century had even presentiment  that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour  we see then the means of production and of exchange on whose  foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up were generated in feudal  society at certain stage in the development of these means of  production and of exchange the conditions under which feudal society  produced and exchanged the feudal organisation of agriculture and  manufacturing industry in one word the feudal relations of property  became no longer compatible with the already developed productive  forces they became so many fetters they had to be burst asunder they  were burst asunder  into their place stepped free competition accompanied by social and  political constitution adapted to it and by the economical and  political sway of the bourgeois class  a similar movement is going on before our own eyes modern bourgeois  society with its relations of production of exchange and of property  a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of  exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the  powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells for  many decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the  history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern  conditions of production against the property relations that are the  conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule it is  enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return  put on its trial each time more threateningly the existence of the  entire bourgeois society in these crises great part not only of the  existing products but also of the previously created productive  forces are periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an  epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an  absurdity the epidemic of over production society suddenly finds  itself put back into state of momentary barbarism it appears as if  famine universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every  means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and  why because there is too much civilisation too much means of  subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive  forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the  development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary  they have become too powerful for these conditions by which they are  fettered and so soon as they overcome these fetters they bring  disorder into the whole of bourgeois society endanger the existence of  bourgeois property the conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow  to comprise the wealth created by them and how does the bourgeoisie  get over these crises on the one hand inforced destruction of mass  of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and  by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by  paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by  diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented  the weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground  are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself  but not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to  itself it has also called into existence the men who are to wield  those weapons the modern working class the proletarians  in proportion as the bourgeoisie _i e_ capital is developed in the  same proportion is the proletariat the modern working class  developed class of labourers who live only so long as they find  work and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital  these labourers who must sell themselves piece meal are commodity  like every other article of commerce and are consequently exposed to  all the vicissitudes of competition to all the fluctuations of the  market  owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour the  work of the proletarians has lost all individual character and  consequently all charm for the workman he becomes an appendage of the  machine and it is only the most simple most monotonous and most  easily acquired knack that is required of him hence the cost of  production of workman is restricted almost entirely to the means of  subsistence that he requires for his maintenance and for the  propagation of his race but the price of commodity and therefore  also of labour is equal to its cost of production in proportion  therefore as the repulsiveness of the work increases the wage  decreases nay more in proportion as the use of machinery and division  of labour increases in the same proportion the burden of toil also  increases whether by prolongation of the working hours by increase of  the work exacted in given time or by increased speed of the  machinery etc  modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal  master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist masses of  labourers crowded into the factory are organised like soldiers as  privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of  perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants not only are they slaves  of the bourgeois class and of the bourgeois state they are daily and  hourly enslaved by the machine by the over looker and above all by  the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself the more openly this  despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim the more petty the  more hateful and the more embittering it is  the less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour  in other words the more modern industry becomes developed the more is  the labour of men superseded by that of women differences of age and  sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working  class all are instruments of labour more or less expensive to use  according to their age and sex  no sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer so  far at an end that he receives his wages in cash than he is set upon  by the other portions of the bourgeoisie the landlord the shopkeeper  the pawnbroker etc  the lower strata of the middle class the small tradespeople  shopkeepers retired tradesmen generally the handicraftsmen and  peasants all these sink gradually into the proletariat partly because  their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which modern  industry is carried on and is swamped in the competition with the  large capitalists partly because their specialized skill is rendered  worthless by the new methods of production thus the proletariat is  recruited from all classes of the population  the proletariat goes through various stages of development with its  birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie at first the contest is  carried on by individual labourers then by the workpeople of  factory then by the operatives of one trade in one locality against  the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them they direct their  attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production but against  the instruments of production themselves they destroy imported wares  that compete with their labour they smash to pieces machinery they  set factories ablaze they seek to restore by force the vanished status  of the workman of the middle ages  at this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered  over the whole country and broken up by their mutual competition if  anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies this is not yet the  consequence of their own active union but of the union of the  bourgeoisie which class in order to attain its own political ends is  compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion and is moreover yet  for time able to do so at this stage therefore the proletarians  do not fight their enemies but the enemies of their enemies the  remnants of absolute monarchy the landowners the non industrial  bourgeois the petty bourgeoisie thus the whole historical movement is  concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie every victory so obtained  is victory for the bourgeoisie  but with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases  in number it becomes concentrated in greater masses its strength  grows and it feels that strength more the various interests and  conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and  more equalised in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions  of labour and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level  the growing competition among the bourgeois and the resulting  commercial crises make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating  the unceasing improvement of machinery ever more rapidly developing  makes their livelihood more and more precarious the collisions between  individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the  character of collisions between two classes thereupon the workers  begin to form combinations trades unions against the bourgeois they  club together in order to keep up the rate of wages they found  permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these  occasional revolts here and there the contest breaks out into riots  now and then the workers are victorious but only for time the real  fruit of their battles lies not in the immediate result but in the  ever expanding union of the workers this union is helped on by the  improved means of communication that are created by modern industry and  that place the workers of different localities in contact with one  another it was just this contact that was needed to centralise the  numerous local struggles all of the same character into one national  struggle between classes but every class struggle is political  struggle and that union to attain which the burghers of the middle  ages with their miserable highways required centuries the modern  proletarians thanks to railways achieve in few years  this organisation of the proletarians into class and consequently  into political party is continually being upset again by the  competition between the workers themselves but it ever rises up again  stronger firmer mightier it compels legislative recognition of  particular interests of the workers by taking advantage of the  divisions among the bourgeoisie itself thus the ten hours bill in  england was carried  altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further  in many ways the course of development of the proletariat the  bourgeoisie finds itself involved in constant battle at first with  the aristocracy later on with those portions of the bourgeoisie  itself whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of  industry at all times with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries in  all these battles it sees itself compelled to appeal to the  proletariat to ask for its help and thus to drag it into the  political arena the bourgeoisie itself therefore supplies the  proletariat with its own instruments of political and general  education in other words it furnishes the proletariat with weapons  for fighting the bourgeoisie  further as we have already seen entire sections of the ruling classes  are by the advance of industry precipitated into the proletariat or  are at least threatened in their conditions of existence these also  supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and  progress  finally in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour the  process of dissolution going on within the ruling class in fact within  the whole range of society assumes such violent glaring character  that small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift and joins  the revolutionary class the class that holds the future in its hands  just as therefore at an earlier period section of the nobility  went over to the bourgeoisie so now portion of the bourgeoisie goes  over to the proletariat and in particular portion of the bourgeois  ideologists who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending  theoretically the historical movement as whole  of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today  the proletariat alone is really revolutionary class the other  classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry the  proletariat is its special and essential product the lower middle  class the small manufacturer the shopkeeper the artisan the  peasant all these fight against the bourgeoisie to save from  extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class they are  therefore not revolutionary but conservative nay more they are  reactionary for they try to roll back the wheel of history if by  chance they are revolutionary they are so only in view of their  impending transfer into the proletariat they thus defend not their  present but their future interests they desert their own standpoint  to place themselves at that of the proletariat  the dangerous class the social scum that passively rotting mass  thrown off by the lowest layers of old society may here and there be  swept into the movement by proletarian revolution its conditions of  life however prepare it far more for the part of bribed tool of  reactionary intrigue  in the conditions of the proletariat those of old society at large are  already virtually swamped the proletarian is without property his  relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with  the bourgeois family relations modern industrial labour modern  subjection to capital the same in england as in france in america as  in germany has stripped him of every trace of national character law  morality religion are to him so many bourgeois prejudices behind  which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests  all the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify  their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their  conditions of appropriation the proletarians cannot become masters of  the productive forces of society except by abolishing their own  previous mode of appropriation and thereby also every other previous  mode of appropriation they have nothing of their own to secure and to  fortify their mission is to destroy all previous securities for and  insurances of individual property  all previous historical movements were movements of minorities or in  the interests of minorities the proletarian movement is the  self conscious independent movement of the immense majority in the  interests of the immense majority the proletariat the lowest stratum  of our present society cannot stir cannot raise itself up without  the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into  the air  though not in substance yet in form the struggle of the proletariat  with the bourgeoisie is at first national struggle the proletariat  of each country must of course first of all settle matters with its  own bourgeoisie  in depicting the most general phases of the development of the  proletariat we traced the more or less veiled civil war raging within  existing society up to the point where that war breaks out into open  revolution and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the  foundation for the sway of the proletariat  hitherto every form of society has been based as we have already  seen on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes but in  order to oppress class certain conditions must be assured to it  under which it can at least continue its slavish existence the serf  in the period of serfdom raised himself to membership in the commune  just as the petty bourgeois under the yoke of feudal absolutism  managed to develop into bourgeois the modern laborer on the  contrary instead of rising with the progress of industry sinks deeper  and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class he  becomes pauper and pauperism develops more rapidly than population  and wealth and here it becomes evident that the bourgeoisie is unfit  any longer to be the ruling class in society and to impose its  conditions of existence upon society as an over riding law it is unfit  to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave  within his slavery because it cannot help letting him sink into such  state that it has to feed him instead of being fed by him society  can no longer live under this bourgeoisie in other words its  existence is no longer compatible with society  the essential condition for the existence and for the sway of the  bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital the  condition for capital is wage labour wage labour rests exclusively on  competition between the laborers the advance of industry whose  involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie replaces the isolation of the  labourers due to competition by their revolutionary combination due  to association the development of modern industry therefore cuts  from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie  produces and appropriates products what the bourgeoisie therefore  produces above all is its own grave diggers its fall and the victory  of the proletariat are equally inevitable  ii  in what relation do the communists stand to the proletarians as  whole  the communists do not form separate party opposed to other  working class parties  they have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat  as whole  they do not set up any sectarian principles of their own by which to  shape and mould the proletarian movement  the communists are distinguished from the other working class parties  by this only 1 in the national struggles of the proletarians of the  different countries they point out and bring to the front the common  interests of the entire proletariat independently of all nationality   2 in the various stages of development which the struggle of the  working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through they always  and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as whole  the communists therefore are on the one hand practically the most  advanced and resolute section of the working class parties of every  country that section which pushes forward all others on the other  hand theoretically they have over the great mass of the proletariat  the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march the  conditions and the ultimate general results of the proletarian  movement  the immediate aim of the communist is the same as that of all the other  proletarian parties formation of the proletariat into class  overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy conquest of political power by  the proletariat  the theoretical conclusions of the communists are in no way based on  ideas or principles that have been invented or discovered by this or  that would be universal reformer they merely express in general  terms actual relations springing from an existing class struggle from  a historical movement going on under our very eyes the abolition of  existing property relations is not at all distinctive feature of  communism  all property relations in the past have continually been subject to  historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions  the french revolution for example abolished feudal property in favour  of bourgeois property  the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of  property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern  bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of  the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on  class antagonisms on the exploitation of the many by the few  in this sense the theory of the communists may be summed up in the  single sentence abolition of private property  we communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the  right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of man own  labour which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal  freedom activity and independence  hard won self acquired self earned property do you mean the property  of the petty artisan and of the small peasant form of property that  preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the  development of industry has to great extent already destroyed it and  is still destroying it daily  or do you mean modern bourgeois private property  but does wage labour create any property for the labourer not bit  it creates capital e that kind of property which exploits  wage labour and which cannot increase except upon condition of  begetting new supply of wage labour for fresh exploitation property  in its present form is based on the antagonism of capital and  wage labour let us examine both sides of this antagonism  to be capitalist is to have not only purely personal but social  _status_ in production capital is collective product and only by  the united action of many members nay in the last resort only by the  united action of all members of society can it be set in motion  capital is therefore not personal it is social power  when therefore capital is converted into common property into the  property of all members of society personal property is not thereby  transformed into social property it is only the social character of  the property that is changed it loses its class character  let us now take wage labour  the average price of wage labour is the minimum wage _i e_ that  quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite in  bare existence as labourer what therefore the wage labourer  appropriates by means of his labour merely suffices to prolong and  reproduce bare existence we by no means intend to abolish this  personal appropriation of the products of labour an appropriation that  is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life and that  leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour of others all that  we want to do away with is the miserable character of this  appropriation under which the labourer lives merely to increase  capital and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the  ruling class requires it  in bourgeois society living labour is but means to increase  accumulated labour in communist society accumulated labour is but  means to widen to enrich to promote the existence of the labourer  in bourgeois society therefore the past dominates the present in  communist society the present dominates the past in bourgeois society  capital is independent and has individuality while the living person  is dependent and has no individuality  and the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois  abolition of individuality and freedom and rightly so the abolition  of bourgeois individuality bourgeois independence and bourgeois  freedom is undoubtedly aimed at  by freedom is meant under the present bourgeois conditions of  production free trade free selling and buying  but if selling and buying disappears free selling and buying  disappears also this talk about free selling and buying and all the  other brave words of our bourgeoisie about freedom in general have  meaning if any only in contrast with restricted selling and buying  with the fettered traders of the middle ages but have no meaning when  opposed to the communistic abolition of buying and selling of the  bourgeois conditions of production and of the bourgeoisie itself  you are horrified at our intending to do away with private property  but in your existing society private property is already done away  with for nine tenths of the population its existence for the few is  solely due to its non existence in the hands of those nine tenths you  reproach us therefore with intending to do away with form of  property the necessary condition for whose existence is the  non existence of any property for the immense majority of society  in one word you reproach us with intending to do away with your  property precisely so that is just what we intend  from the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital  money or rent into social power capable of being monopolised  _i e_ from the moment when individual property can no longer be  transformed into bourgeois property into capital from that moment  you say individuality vanishes  you must therefore confess that by individual you mean no other  person than the bourgeois than the middle class owner of property  this person must indeed be swept out of the way and made impossible  communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of  society all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate  the labour of others by means of such appropriation  it has been objected that upon the abolition of private property all  work will cease and universal laziness will overtake us  according to this bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the  dogs through sheer idleness for those of its members who work acquire  nothing and those who acquire anything do not work the whole of this  objection is but another expression of the tautology that there can no  longer be any wage labour when there is no longer any capital  all objections urged against the communistic mode of producing and  appropriating material products have in the same way been urged  against the communistic modes of producing and appropriating  intellectual products just as to the bourgeois the disappearance of  class property is the disappearance of production itself so the  disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the  disappearance of all culture  that culture the loss of which he laments is for the enormous  majority mere training to act as machine  but don wrangle with us so long as you apply to our intended  abolition of bourgeois property the standard of your bourgeois notions  of freedom culture law etc your very ideas are but the outgrowth of  the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property  just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into  law for all will whose essential character and direction are  determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class  the selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal  laws of nature and of reason the social forms springing from your  present mode of production and form of property historical relations  that rise and disappear in the progress of production this  misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you  what you see clearly in the case of ancient property what you admit in  the case of feudal property you are of course forbidden to admit in  the case of your own bourgeois form of property  abolition of the family even the most radical flare up at this  infamous proposal of the communists  on what foundation is the present family the bourgeois family based  on capital on private gain in its completely developed form this  family exists only among the bourgeoisie but this state of things  finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the  proletarians and in public prostitution  the bourgeois family will vanish as matter of course when its  complement vanishes and both will vanish with the vanishing of  capital  do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by  their parents to this crime we plead guilty  but you will say we destroy the most hallowed of relations when we  replace home education by social  and your education is not that also social and determined by the  social conditions under which you educate by the intervention direct  or indirect of society by means of schools etc the communists have  not invented the intervention of society in education they do but seek  to alter the character of that intervention and to rescue education  from the influence of the ruling class  the bourgeois clap trap about the family and education about the  hallowed co relation of parent and child becomes all the more  disgusting the more by the action of modern industry all family ties  among the proletarians are torn asunder and their children transformed  into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labour  but you communists would introduce community of women screams the  whole bourgeoisie in chorus  the bourgeois sees in his wife mere instrument of production he  hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common  and naturally can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of  being common to all will likewise fall to the women  he has not even suspicion that the real point is to do away with the  status of women as mere instruments of production  for the rest nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation  of our bourgeois at the community of women which they pretend is to  be openly and officially established by the communists the communists  have no need to introduce community of women it has existed almost  from time immemorial  our bourgeois not content with having the wives and daughters of their  proletarians at their disposal not to speak of common prostitutes  take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other wives  bourgeois marriage is in reality system of wives in common and thus  at the most what the communists might possibly be reproached with is  that they desire to introduce in substitution for hypocritically  concealed an openly legalised community of women for the rest it is  self evident that the abolition of the present system of production  must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing  from that system _i e_ of prostitution both public and private  the communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish  countries and nationality  the working men have no country we cannot take from them what they  have not got since the proletariat must first of all acquire political  supremacy must rise to be the leading class of the nation must  constitute itself _the_ nation it is so far itself national though  not in the bourgeois sense of the word  national differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily more and  more vanishing owing to the development of the bourgeoisie to freedom  of commerce to the world market to uniformity in the mode of  production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto  the supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still  faster united action of the leading civilised countries at least is  one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat  in proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put  an end to the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put  an end to in proportion as the antagonism between classes within the  nation vanishes the hostility of one nation to another will come to an  end  the charges against communism made from religious philosophical  and generally from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of  serious examination  does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man ideas views  and conceptions in one word man consciousness changes with every  change in the conditions of his material existence in his social  relations and in his social life  what else does the history of ideas prove than that intellectual  production changes its character in proportion as material production  is changed the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of  its ruling class  when people speak of ideas that revolutionise society they do but  express the fact that within the old society the elements of new  one have been created and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps  even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence  when the ancient world was in its last throes the ancient religions  were overcome by christianity when christian ideas succumbed in the  18th century to rationalist ideas feudal society fought its death  battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie the ideas of religious  liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of  free competition within the domain of knowledge   undoubtedly it will be said religious moral philosophical and  juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical  development but religion morality philosophy political science and  law constantly survived this change   there are besides eternal truths such as freedom justice etc  that are common to all states of society but communism abolishes  eternal truths it abolishes all religion and all morality instead of  constituting them on new basis it therefore acts in contradiction to  all past historical experience  what does this accusation reduce itself to the history of all past  society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms  antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs  but whatever form they may have taken one fact is common to all past  ages viz the exploitation of one part of society by the other no  wonder then that the social consciousness of past ages despite all  the multiplicity and variety it displays moves within certain common  forms or general ideas which cannot completely vanish except with the  total disappearance of class antagonisms  the communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional  property relations no wonder that its development involves the most  radical rupture with traditional ideas  but let us have done with the bourgeois objections to communism  we have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the  working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling as  to win the battle of democracy  the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest by degrees  all capital from the bourgeoisie to centralise all instruments of  production in the hands of the state _i e_ of the proletariat  organised as the ruling class and to increase the total of productive  forces as rapidly as possible  of course in the beginning this cannot be effected except by means of  despotic inroads on the rights of property and on the conditions of  bourgeois production by means of measures therefore which appear  economically insufficient and untenable but which in the course of  the movement outstrip themselves necessitate further inroads upon the  old social order and are unavoidable as means of entirely  revolutionising the mode of production  these measures will of course be different in different countries  nevertheless in the most advanced countries the following will be  pretty generally applicable  1 abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land  to public purposes  2 heavy progressive or graduated income tax  3 abolition of all right of inheritance  4 confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels  5 centralisation of credit in the hands of the state by means of  national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly  6 centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the  hands of the state  7 extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the  state the bringing into cultivation of waste lands and the  improvement of the soil generally in accordance with common plan  8 equal liability of all to labour establishment of industrial  armies especially for agriculture  9 combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries gradual  abolition of the distinction between town and country by more  equable distribution of the population over the country  10 free education for all children in public schools abolition of  children factory labour in its present form combination of  education with industrial production c  when in the course of development class distinctions have  disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the hands of  vast association of the whole nation the public power will lose its  political character political power properly so called is merely the  organised power of one class for oppressing another if the proletariat  during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled by the force of  circumstances to organise itself as class if by means of  revolution it makes itself the ruling class and as such sweeps away  by force the old conditions of production then it will along with  these conditions have swept away the conditions for the existence of  class antagonisms and of classes generally and will thereby have  abolished its own supremacy as class  in place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class  antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free  development of each is the condition for the free development of all  iii  socialist and communist literature  1 reactionary socialism  _a feudal socialism_  owing to their historical position it became the vocation of the  aristocracies of france and england to write pamphlets against modern  bourgeois society in the french revolution of july 1830 and in the  english reform agitation these aristocracies again succumbed to the  hateful upstart thenceforth serious political contest was  altogether out of the question literary battle alone remained  possible but even in the domain of literature the old cries of the  restoration period had become impossible  in order to arouse sympathy the aristocracy were obliged to lose  sight apparently of their own interests and to formulate their  indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited  working class alone thus the aristocracy took their revenge by singing  lampoons on their new master and whispering in his ears sinister  prophecies of coming catastrophe  in this way arose feudal socialism half lamentation half lampoon  half echo of the past half menace of the future at times by its  bitter witty and incisive criticism striking the bourgeoisie to the  very heart core but always ludicrous in its effect through total  incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history  the aristocracy in order to rally the people to them waved the  proletarian alms bag in front for banner but the people so often as  it joined them saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms  and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter  one section of the french legitimists and young england exhibited  this spectacle  in pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that  of the bourgeoisie the feudalists forget that they exploited under  circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are  now antiquated in showing that under their rule the modern  proletariat never existed they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is  the necessary offspring of their own form of society  for the rest so little do they conceal the reactionary character of  their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeoisie  amounts to this that under the bourgeois _regime_ class is being  developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of  society  what they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates  proletariat as that it creates _revolutionary_ proletariat  in political practice therefore they join in all coercive measures  against the working class and in ordinary life despite their high  falutin phrases they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from  the tree of industry and to barter truth love and honour for traffic  in wool beetroot sugar and potato spirits  as the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord so has  clerical socialism with feudal socialism  nothing is easier than to give christian asceticism socialist tinge  has not christianity declaimed against private property against  marriage against the state has it not preached in the place of these  charity and poverty celibacy and mortification of the flesh monastic  life and mother church christian socialism is but the holy water with  which the priest consecrates the heart burnings of the aristocrat  _b petty bourgeois socialism_  the feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the  bourgeoisie not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and  perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society the mediaeval  burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the  modern bourgeoisie in those countries which are but little developed  industrially and commercially these two classes still vegetate side by  side with the rising bourgeoisie  in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed  new class of petty bourgeois has been formed fluctuating between  proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing itself as supplementary  part of bourgeois society the individual members of this class  however are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the  action of competition and as modern industry develops they even see  the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an  independent section of modern society to be replaced in manufactures  agriculture and commerce by overlookers bailiffs and shopmen  in countries like france where the peasants constitute far more than  half of the population it was natural that writers who sided with the  proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use in their criticism of  the bourgeois _regime_ the standard of the peasant and petty  bourgeois and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes should  take up the cudgels for the working class thus arose petty bourgeois  socialism sismondi was the head of this school not only in france but  also in england  this school of socialism dissected with great acuteness the  contradictions in the conditions of modern production it laid bare the  hypocritical apologies of economists it proved incontrovertibly the  disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour the  concentration of capital and land in few hands overproduction and  crises it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and  peasant the misery of the proletariat the anarchy in production the  crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth the industrial war  of extermination between nations the dissolution of old moral bonds  of the old family relations of the old nationalities  in its positive aims however this form of socialism aspires either to  restoring the old means of production and of exchange and with them  the old property relations and the old society or to cramping the  modern means of production and of exchange within the framework of the  old property relations that have been and were bound to be exploded  by those means in either case it is both reactionary and utopian  its last words are corporate guilds for manufacture patriarchal  relations in agriculture  ultimately when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all  intoxicating effects of self deception this form of socialism ended in  a miserable fit of the blues  _c german or true socialism_  the socialist and communist literature of france literature that  originated under the pressure of bourgeoisie in power and that was  the expression of the struggle against this power was introduced into  germany at time when the bourgeoisie in that country had just begun  its contest with feudal absolutism  german philosophers would be philosophers and _beaux esprits_  eagerly seized on this literature only forgetting that when these  writings immigrated from france into germany french social conditions  had not immigrated along with them in contact with german social  conditions this french literature lost all its immediate practical  significance and assumed purely literary aspect thus to the german  philosophers of the eighteenth century the demands of the first french  revolution were nothing more than the demands of practical reason in  general and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary french  bourgeoisie signified in their eyes the law of pure will of will as it  was bound to be of true human will generally  the world of the german _literati_ consisted solely in bringing the new  french ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience  or rather in annexing the french ideas without deserting their own  philosophic point of view  this annexation took place in the same way in which foreign language  is appropriated namely by translation  it is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of catholic saints  _over_ the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient  heathendom had been written the german _literati_ reversed this  process with the profane french literature they wrote their  philosophical nonsense beneath the french original for instance  beneath the french criticism of the economic functions of money they  wrote alienation of humanity and beneath the french criticism of the  bourgeois state they wrote dethronement of the category of the  general and so forth  the introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the  french historical criticisms they dubbed philosophy of action true  socialism german science of socialism philosophical foundation of  socialism and so on  the french socialist and communist literature was thus completely  emasculated and since it ceased in the hands of the german to express  the struggle of one class with the other he felt conscious of having  overcome french one sidedness and of representing not true  requirements but the requirements of truth not the interests of the  proletariat but the interests of human nature of man in general who  belongs to no class has no reality who exists only in the misty realm  of philosophical fantasy  this german socialism which took its schoolboy task so seriously and  solemnly and extolled its poor stock in trade in such mountebank  fashion meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence  the fight of the german and especially of the prussian bourgeoisie  against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy in other words the  liberal movement became more earnest  by this the long wished for opportunity was offered to true  socialism of confronting the political movement with the socialist  demands of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism  against representative government against bourgeois competition  bourgeois freedom of the press bourgeois legislation bourgeois  liberty and equality and of preaching to the masses that they had  nothing to gain and everything to lose by this bourgeois movement  german socialism forgot in the nick of time that the french  criticism whose silly echo it was presupposed the existence of modern  bourgeois society with its corresponding economic conditions of  existence and the political constitution adapted thereto the very  things whose attainment was the object of the pending struggle in  germany  to the absolute governments with their following of parsons  professors country squires and officials it served as welcome  scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie  it was sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and bullets  with which these same governments just at that time dosed the german  working class risings  while this true socialism thus served the governments as weapon for  fighting the german bourgeoisie it at the same time directly  represented reactionary interest the interest of the german  philistines in germany the _petty bourgeois_ class _relique_ of the  sixteenth century and since then constantly cropping up again under  various forms is the real social basis of the existing state of  things  to preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in  germany the industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie  threatens it with certain destruction on the one hand from the  concentration of capital on the other from the rise of  revolutionary proletariat true socialism appeared to kill these two  birds with one stone it spread like an epidemic  the robe of speculative cobwebs embroidered with flowers of rhetoric  steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment this transcendental robe in  which the german socialists wrapped their sorry eternal truths all  skin and bone served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods  amongst such public and on its part german socialism recognised  more and more its own calling as the bombastic representative of the  petty bourgeois philistine  it proclaimed the german nation to be the model nation and the german  petty philistine to be the typical man to every villainous meanness of  this model man it gave hidden higher socialistic interpretation  the exact contrary of its real character it went to the extreme length  of directly opposing the brutally destructive tendency of communism  and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class  struggles with very few exceptions all the so called socialist and  communist publications that now 1847 circulate in germany belong to  the domain of this foul and enervating literature  2 conservative or bourgeois socialism  a part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances  in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society  to this section belong economists philanthropists humanitarians  improvers of the condition of the working class organisers of charity  members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals  temperance fanatics hole and corner reformers of every imaginable  kind this form of socialism has moreover been worked out into  complete systems  we may cite proudhon _philosophie de la misère_ as an example of this  form  the socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social  conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting  therefrom they desire the existing state of society minus its  revolutionary and disintegrating elements they wish for bourgeoisie  without proletariat the bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in  which it is supreme to be the best and bourgeois socialism develops  this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems  in requiring the proletariat to carry out such system and thereby to  march straightway into the social new jerusalem it but requires in  reality that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of  existing society but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning  the bourgeoisie  a second and more practical but less systematic form of this  socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes  of the working class by showing that no mere political reform but  only change in the material conditions of existence in economic  relations could be of any advantage to them by changes in the  material conditions of existence this form of socialism however by  no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of  production an abolition that can be effected only by revolution but  administrative reforms based on the continued existence of these  relations reforms therefore that in no respect affect the relations  between capital and labour but at the best lessen the cost and  simplify the administrative work of bourgeois government  bourgeois socialism attains adequate expression when and only when  it becomes mere figure of speech  free trade for the benefit of the working class protective duties  for the benefit of the working class prison reform for the benefit of  the working class this is the last word and the only seriously meant  word of bourgeois socialism  it is summed up in the phrase the bourgeois is bourgeois for the  benefit of the working class  3 critical utopian socialism and communism  we do not here refer to that literature which in every great modern  revolution has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat  such as the writings of babeuf and others  the first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends  made in times of universal excitement when feudal society was being  overthrown these attempts necessarily failed owing to the then  undeveloped state of the proletariat as well as to the absence of the  economic conditions for its emancipation conditions that had yet to be  produced and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone  the revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of  the proletariat had necessarily reactionary character it inculcated  universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form  the socialist and communist systems properly so called those of  saint simon fourier owen and others spring into existence in the  early undeveloped period described above of the struggle between  proletariat and bourgeoisie see section 1 bourgeois and  proletarians  the founders of these systems see indeed the class antagonisms as  well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form  of society but the proletariat as yet in its infancy offers to them  the spectacle of class without any historical initiative or any  independent political movement  since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the  development of industry the economic situation as they find it does  not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation  of the proletariat they therefore search after new social science  after new social laws that are to create these conditions  historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action  historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones and  the gradual spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat to the  organisation of society specially contrived by these inventors future  history resolves itself in their eyes into the propaganda and the  practical carrying out of their social plans  in the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring chiefly  for the interests of the working class as being the most suffering  class only from the point of view of being the most suffering class  does the proletariat exist for them  the undeveloped state of the class struggle as well as their own  surroundings causes socialists of this kind to consider themselves far  superior to all class antagonisms they want to improve the condition  of every member of society even that of the most favoured hence they  habitually appeal to society at large without distinction of class  nay by preference to the ruling class for how can people when once  they understand their system fail to see in it the best possible plan  of the best possible state of society  hence they reject all political and especially all revolutionary  action they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means and  endeavour by small experiments necessarily doomed to failure and by  the force of example to pave the way for the new social gospel  such fantastic pictures of future society painted at time when the  proletariat is still in very undeveloped state and has but  fantastic conception of its own position correspond with the first  instinctive yearnings of that class for general reconstruction of  society  but these socialist and communist publications contain also critical  element they attack every principle of existing society hence they  are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the  working class the practical measures proposed in them such as the  abolition of the distinction between town and country of the family  of the carrying on of industries for the account of private  individuals and of the wage system the proclamation of social  harmony the conversion of the functions of the state into mere  superintendence of production all these proposals point solely to the  disappearance of class antagonisms which were at that time only just  cropping up and which in these publications are recognised in their  earliest indistinct and undefined forms only these proposals  therefore are of purely utopian character  the significance of critical utopian socialism and communism bears an  inverse relation to historical development in proportion as the modern  class struggle develops and takes definite shape this fantastic  standing apart from the contest these fantastic attacks on it lose  all practical value and all theoretical justification therefore  although the originators of these systems were in many respects  revolutionary their disciples have in every case formed mere  reactionary sects they hold fast by the original views of their  masters in opposition to the progressive historical development of the  proletariat they therefore endeavour and that consistently to  deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms they  still dream of experimental realisation of their social utopias of  founding isolated phalansteres of establishing home colonies of  setting up little icaria duodecimo editions of the new  jerusalem and to realise all these castles in the air they are  compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois by  degrees they sink into the category of the reactionary conservative  socialists depicted above differing from these only by more systematic  pedantry and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the  miraculous effects of their social science  they therefore violently oppose all political action on the part of  the working class such action according to them can only result from  blind unbelief in the new gospel  the owenites in england and the fourierists in france respectively  oppose the chartists and the réformistes  iv  position of the communists in relation to the various existing  opposition parties  section ii has made clear the relations of the communists to the  existing working class parties such as the chartists in england and  the agrarian reformers in america  the communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims for the  enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class but in the  movement of the present they also represent and take care of the  future of that movement in france the communists ally themselves with  the social democrats against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie  reserving however the right to take up critical position in regard  to phrases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great  revolution  in switzerland they support the radicals without losing sight of the  fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements partly of  democratic socialists in the french sense partly of radical  bourgeois  in poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution  as the prime condition for national emancipation that party which  fomented the insurrection of cracow in 1846  in germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in  revolutionary way against the absolute monarchy the feudal  squirearchy and the petty bourgeoisie  but they never cease for single instant to instil into the working  class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism  between bourgeoisie and proletariat in order that the german workers  may straightaway use as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie the  social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily  introduce along with its supremacy and in order that after the fall  of the reactionary classes in germany the fight against the  bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin  the communists turn their attention chiefly to germany because that  country is on the eve of bourgeois revolution that is bound to be  carried out under more advanced conditions of european civilisation  and with much more developed proletariat than that of england was in  the seventeenth and of france in the eighteenth century and because  the bourgeois revolution in germany will be but the prelude to an  immediately following proletarian revolution  in short the communists everywhere support every revolutionary  movement against the existing social and political order of things  in all these movements they bring to the front as the leading question  in each the property question no matter what its degree of  development at the time  finally they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the  democratic parties of all countries  the communists disdain to conceal their views and aims they openly  declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow  of all existing social conditions let the ruling classes tremble at  communistic revolution the proletarians have nothing to lose but their  chains they have world to win  working men of all countries unite \n"
